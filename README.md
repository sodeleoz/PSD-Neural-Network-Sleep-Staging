The contents of this repository were used for the undergraduate thesis entitled: Macrostructure and Dynamics of Sleep through Power Spectral Density Neural Network Sleep Staging.

The dataset used in the study was obtained from the polysomnogram conducted by Rezaei et al., (2017) entitled: EEG/EOG/EMG data from a cross sectional study on psychophysiological insomnia and normal sleep subjects. The data was preprocessed using the FieldTrip toolbox in Matlab, following a preprocessing pipeline from FieldTrip as well. The code used for preprocessing is found in the Relevant Codes folder. The extracted features from each subject from the preprocessing pipeline can be found in the Extracted Features folder. 

The feedforward neural network and .mlx file used to train the model to classify the sleep stages are also placed in the Relevant Codes folder.
